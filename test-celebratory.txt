mirando cosas viejas hallé un poema en una servilleta casi borrado eran sólo una líneas era mi letra estaba dedicado a la mujer que amo los versos eran tristes y mal logrados pero eran un reflejo de aquellos años los años mas terribles que me han pasado y mientras los leía me ahogaba en llanto no me acostumbro no no me acostumbro todavía al acostarme la recuerdo y al despertar amor tiemblo de miedo al descubrir que sólo estaba en mi sueño no me acostumbro no no me acostumbro hice mil cosas para comenzar de nuevo dejé de frecuentar amigos en común pero me siento que estoy preso en aquel tiempo mirando cosas viejas hallé una foto en ella se veía besando mis ojos quisiera ahora cerrarlos y sentir lo mismo después de tanto tiempo hoy pido poco no me acostumbro no no me acostumbro todavía al acostarme la recuerdo y al despertar amor tiemblo de miedo al descubrir que sólo estaba en mis sueños no me acostumbro no no me acostumbro hice mil cosas para comenzar de nuevo dejé de frecuentar amigos en común pero me siento que estoy preso en aquel tiempo no me acostumbro no se vivir sin ti como un loco hice mil cosas para comenzar de nuevo probé mil rutas todas dan a tí no me acostumbro no se vivir sin ti no no no no se olvidar tu recuerdo en mi memoria y como yo lo quiero yo lo dejo ahí no me acostumbro no se vivir sin ti y te repito que no puedo acostumbrarme que no daría en la mañana despertarme y que estuvieras conmigo aquí no puedo no puedo no sé vivir sin ti es que cuando el amor se siente así tan dentro se le convierte en un infierno al corazón no me acostumbro no se vivir sin ti esta soledad me está acabando me está matando y en el silencio extraño tu voz no me acostumbro no se vivir sin ti no soy libre porque me siento que estoy preso en aquel tiempo

when i was fifteen sixteen when i started really to play the guitar i definitely wanted to become a musician it was almost impossible because the dream was so big i didn t see any chance because i was living in a little town i was studying and when i finally broke away from school and became a musician i thought well i may have a bit of a chance because all i every wanted to do is music but not only play music but compose music at that time in germany in 1969 70 they already had discotheques so i would take my car and go to a discotheque and sing maybe 30 minutes i think i had about 7 8 songs i would partially sleep in the car because i didn t want to drive home and that help me for about almost 2 years to survive in the beginning i wanted to do a album with the sound of the 50s the sound of the 60s of the 70s and then have a sound of the future and i said wait a second i know the synthesizer why don t i use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future and i didn t have any idea what to do but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track which was then synch to the moog modular i knew that it could be a sound of the future but i didn t realise how much impact it would be my name is giovanni giorgio but everybody calls me giorgio you want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct you can do whatever you want so nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do
