in the shadows of tall buildings of fallen angels on the ceilings faded colors pieces left incomplete the line moves slowly past the electric fence across the borders between continents in the cathedrals of new york and rome there is a feeling that you should just go home and spend the lifetime finding out just where that is in the shadows of tall buildings the architecture is slowly peeling marble statues and glass dividers someone is watching all of the outsiders the line moves slowly through the numbered gate past the mosaic of the head of state in the cathedrals of new york and rome there is a feeling that you should just go home and spend the lifetime finding out just where that is in the shadows of tall buildings of open arches endlessly kneeling sonic landscapes echoing vistas someone is listening from a safe distance the line moves slowly into a fading light a final moment in the dead of night in the cathedrals of new york and rome there is a feeling that you should just go home and spend the lifetime finding out just where that is in the cathedrals of new york and rome there is a feeling that you should just go home and spend the lifetime finding out just where that is
sometimes you feel like a shame or like a ruse a half cooked idea or a trick to be used then sometimes you feel so lowly haunted and stark waving in the wind like a flag that s torn apart but we all walk blindy when we stagger and we strut and we re all dealt the hands with the cards of our luck and we all bow down silent and the words are awe struck by the shameless light of the broken afternoon i went walking in the night all alone darkness seeping slowly in my flesh and in my bone and the solitary biting at the thoughts inside my head and the words came slowly and the unborn dream said that we all lose the path to the black and the blue but we are come back slackly to the tried and the true we ll all come together though it s never too soon we ll all see the light of the broken afternoon in the scientific evening jesus left too soon trading his last dollar for a dirty motel room cause he gave all of his riches before he knew what he had money isn t evil and people aren t bad now we all just descend out to the mud and the dirt and we all go insane from the pain and the hurt and all of us are swayed by the hungry pale moon and we ll all wake up clear from the broken afternoon i used to be young but i m not old now the shimmering passing of you scotty pal the path to now or never is paved with ambition plain as a sail in the wind or an empty garden space and we all till and toil in the slowly rising dawn and we re all fit to fail til the future s finally won yeah we re all faintly waiting for the young bride to bloom in the shuttering light of the broken afternoon

spoken a couple of years back i come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio and while he was reciting some poetry to me that he d written i saw that he was about a step away from dyin and i couldn t help but wonder why and the lines of this song occurred to me i m happy to say he s no longer wasted and he s got him a good woman and i d like to dedicate this to john and june who helped show me how to beat the devil it was winter time in nashville down on music city row and i was lookin for a place to get myself out of the cold to warm the frozen feelin that was eatin at my soul keep the chilly wind off my guitar my thirsty wanted whisky my hungry needed beans but it d been of month of paydays since i d heard that eagle scream so with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams i left my pride and stepped inside a bar actually i guess you d could call it a tavern cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor friendly shadows i saw that there was just one old man sittin at the bar and in the mirror i could see him checkin me and my guitar an he turned and said come up here boy and show us what you are i said i m dry he bought me a beer he nodded at my guitar and said it s a tough life ain t it i just looked at him he said you ain t makin any money are you i said you ve been readin my mail he just smiled and said let me see that guitar i ve got something you oughta hear then he laid it on me sung if you waste your time a talkin to the people who don t listen to the things that you are sayin who do you think s gonna hear and if you should die explainin how the things that they complain about are things they could be changin who do you think s gonna care there were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind who were crucified for what they tried to show and their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time cos the truth remains that no one wants to know spoken well the old man was a stranger but i d heard his song before back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door when no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor and lonesome was more than a state of mind you see the devil haunts a hungry man if you don t wanna join him you got to beat him i ain t sayin i beat the devil but i drank his beer for nothing then i stole his song sung and you still can hear me singin to the people who don t listen to the things that i am sayin prayin someone s gonna hear and i guess i ll die explaining how the things that they complain about are things they could be changin hopin someone s gonna care i was born a lonely singer and i m bound to die the same but i ve got to feed the hunger in my soul and if i never have a nickel i won t ever die ashamed cos i don t believe that no one wants to know
