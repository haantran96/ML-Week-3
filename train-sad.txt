quickly forgetting was the way i lived my life try telling me your name or try telling me don t worry everything i knew would quickly wither and die and all echoes would be buried in the sound of living the sound of my feet on the sidewalk that was me treasure hunting i would bury what i found that was me the gold digger underground quickly forgotten was that forgetful way of life when i left home when i lived as if i d died sitting on a rock and doing nothing alone for so long in the dark i found my sight there you name was written large in letters bright and there my faith was worry not declared the night in the great void of my life i could feel the shape of what was missing like the way the woolly mammoth stands so tall and bold in our minds i was shaken at the size of my cry and the true love it described a new day is dawning now and so ends my holy night it s back to the world i go back to the girls and shows and other worldly woes and their unfurling flows will i carry myself slowly enough to remember i sit on a dark rock doing nothing still just crowded in there s the love in flesh and bones

show me where your car is parked and i ll drive it for you i am made of light and dark but i shine before you all this water you ve charted on this blue ocean i can t stop what you ve started and when i say oh don t you want me don t you need me cause i i feel let down the same red ruby blood flows through me but i don t feel it now show me where you lost your heart and i ll find it for you but all these strings on my guitar won t solve this for you all this ice that you ve broken won t hold you up from all these lies that you ve spoken cause all these doctors say that this is an emergency i d give my eyesight for a little bit of urgency or just some signs of life consider this a courtesy from me to you cause i don t know how much longer i can drive you home it s just a little closer to your grave but i still remember all the things you gave me cause all these doctors say that this is an emergency i d give my eyesight for a little bit of urgency or just some signs of life from you

i met a girl on halloween well she was lost and i was drunk and it was dark and cold out when we left and as we walked the rain started the leaves ive felt with every step and all around around us people slept alone with their dreams the wind came down from out the planes and blew the leaves out through the streets i wondered how far leaves could realy fly would they rest in several yards or make it to the city or would they end up in the river just to float away she pointed to a small brick house and said it was where she grew up the lights were out she asked if we could stop for a while her hair was still just getting wet water running down her neck collecting in the hand printed cement beneath her feet apparently there had been a death someone close had nothing left because she hadn t left him in the end i saw her blush when i asked if she always talked like that she said it only happened when she drank and later on i felt her hand slipping into my cold fist she promised me a kiss as soon as we got home her costume had begun to tear she ran ahead and turned to me her laughter echoed through the empty streets

i m weary from this river it flows far but never nearer to my home and the war is upon the shores keep the single girls indoors and so all my love songs fall on wasted ears i grow tired of this highway it runs far but never my way don t you know but the company of strangers and the close and the present dangers seem to pick me up like an old crow in the snow because i m a stranger in a strange land guess i left the world behind yea my love is like the galaxy seems slow but it sure does shine and when i m gone you ll know me by the friends i leave behind i m weary of this losing but what choice is there in choosing if you find yourself a stanger in a stranger place with your beat up shoes and an old suitcase and a wristwatch that don t ever seem to tell the time but there s a warm and a gentle feeling it ain t ever worth concealing what you see and the rains inside my brains keeps the memories contained but i miss you like the wind misses the trees because i m a stranger in a strange land guess i left the world behind but my love is like the galaxy seems slow but it sure does shine and when i m gone you ll know me by the friends i leave behind
